# PIZZA_SALES_REPORT
Generating insight for Pizza sales using Power BI
following are the steps:
Step 1: I kick-started by importing raw data into Power BI Desktop, laying the foundation for our pizza sales report.

Step 2: With precision and finesse, I cleaned and transformed our data using the powerful capabilities of Power Query Editor, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Step 3: The real magic happened with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). We harnessed its potential to generate invaluable insights, unraveling patterns and trends within the data.

Step 4: Finally, I brought our data to life by creating stunning visualizations that tell the story of our pizza business. From mouthwatering charts to dynamic graphs, every visualization was crafted with care.
